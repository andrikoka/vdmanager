## State of code ##
We have few sandbox-experiments, every "stuff" is very basic, demo-purposes only, however we have an almost usable class-diagram (at the school we used a RUP-like method to design the software, but it's still long way to go), some newbie code-fragments, etc.
At the very moment, I (Fiber) am the only one who is still dedicated to this project.
If you wish to help, you can contact me trough this site.

## Why? ##
At the very begining i used few twin-panel file managers, for example Volkov Commander, Norton Commander, Total Commander, Krusader, Midnight Commander etc.
My first linux twin-panel file manager experience was: this is a good stuff, but i can't use this piece of software other than Linux.
Around 5 years passed, and our Software Technology teacher (Lajos Ficsor at University of Miskolc) offered an alternative way to get a mark: create a team, and design a software using the (almost) standard ways of software engineering. As a team, we created lot of documentation, plans and everything. We accomplished our goal, 4 of us got a good mark.
```
Our goal to create a usefull file manager on three platform (Win/Lin/Mac).
It is a University-project, our first goal to learn how to create a software 
from scratch, using the "standard" engineering models / ways. 
```

We managed to create a good plan, but its very-very far from perfect, not to mention, its almost impossible to code.
So first, i need to fix the mission impossible plans, and go on with the coding. Any help are welcome.
